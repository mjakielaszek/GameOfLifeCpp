# Game Of Life

### Each character represents a different organism with their own unique moves, fight and breeding mechanisms but aslo strength and initiative statistics. In each move organisms act in descending order based on the initiative statistic. If two organisms have equal initiative the older one moves first. If an organism goes on an already taken spot, the winner of the fight is the one with higher strengh statistic.
### Human (H) is controlled by the user with arrows. He has a special ability (Magic Potion) which increases his strenght to 10 and decreases it back to original value (5) with each turn. The special ability has a cooldown of 5 turns after its deactivation.

#### In the implementation following libraries are used: 
 - vector,
 - Windows.h,
 - conio.h,
 - stdlib.h,
 - stdio.h,
